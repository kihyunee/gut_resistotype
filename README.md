## About
**This is the repository for the analysis scripts and data files used in the following study:**

Population-level impacts of antibiotic usage on the human gut microbiome. *Unpublished.* (2021) Kihyun Lee, Sebastien Raguideau, Kimmo Sir`en, Francesco Asnicar, Fabio Cumbo, Falk Hildebrand, Nicola Segata, Chang-Jun Cha, Christopher Quince


## Data files used in the analyses

**1. Human microbiome metagenome assemblies previously published in [Pasolli et al., 2019, Cell 176, 649â€“662](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.01.001)**

Fasta files can be accessed following the instructions provided in http://segatalab.cibio.unitn.it/data/Pasolli_et_al.html

Sample metadata provided in Pasolli et al. 2019 was additionally curated with respect to (a) health and disease status of the subject and (b) antibiotic usage preceding the sampling. The final metadata used in our study is provided in this link: https://github.com/kihyunee/gut_resistotype/blob/data/sfile-microbiome-sample-detail.tsv

**2. NCBI RefSeq prokaryotic genome assemblies accessed at 2019/04/19**

Assembly accession numbers (RefSeq/GenBank) of the prokaryotic genomes analyzed in our study is provided in this link:
