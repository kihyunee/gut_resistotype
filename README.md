## About
**This is the repository for the analysis scripts and data files used in the following study:**

Population-level impacts of antibiotic usage on the human gut microbiome. *Unpublished.* (2021) Kihyun Lee, Sebastien Raguideau, Kimmo Sir`en, Francesco Asnicar, Fabio Cumbo, Falk Hildebrand, Nicola Segata, Chang-Jun Cha, Christopher Quince


## Data files used in the analyses

**1. Human microbiome metagenome assemblies previously published in [Pasolli et al., 2019, Cell 176, 649â€“662](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.01.001)**

Fasta files can be accessed following the instructions provided in http://segatalab.cibio.unitn.it/data/Pasolli_et_al.html

Sample metadata provided in Pasolli et al. 2019 was additionally curated with respect to (a) health and disease status of the subject and (b) antibiotic usage preceding the sampling. The final metadata used in our study is provided in this link: [microbiome sample metadata](https://github.com/kihyunee/gut_resistotype/blob/data/sfile-microbiome-sample-detail.tsv)

**2. NCBI RefSeq prokaryotic genome assemblies accessed at 2019/04/19**

Assembly accession numbers (RefSeq/GenBank) of the prokaryotic genomes analyzed in our study is provided in this link: [genome accession list](https://github.com/kihyunee/gut_resistotype/blob/data/refseq_genbank_assembly_acc_pair.nover.tsv)

**3. Modified CARD database**

We used the database of protein sequences for known ARGs, which was created by modifying the October 2017 version of [CARD](https://card.mcmaster.ca/), cite [Jia et al. 2017](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkw1004)

For this modified version of CARD, the following files are provided in this repository.



## From assembled metagenomes to annotated ORFs

## From reference genomes to annotated ORFs

## From annotated metagenomic ORFs to nomalized abundance (copies per genome, cpg) profile of ARG families in samples

## From annotated ORFs from metagenomes and reference genomes to the catalogue of ARG ORFs

## From the catalogue of ARG ORFs to the clustered catalogues of ARGs
